## Class Variables
```KOTLIN

## Initialisation 
```KOTLIN
var gd = GameDriver(GameConfig())
```
* Creates new board object given contents of GameConfig data object.
* Creates application context for game driver.
* Creates connection to game database: `this.db`
* Creates connection to database DAO: `this.playerDAO`
## Game Mechanics
### Play Move
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.playMove(x : Int, y: Int) : WinCondition
```
#### Input Logic
* `this.currentPlayer` places a puck on the game board.
* If `this.currentPlayer` is an `AIPlayer`, `AIPlayer.generateRandomPlay(...)` is called to randomly place a puck within board constraints.
* If `this.currentPlayer` is a `HumanPlayer`, a puck is placed at x and y. If x and y are missing under this case: 0, 0 are the assumed coordinates.
#### Output Logic 
* If the puck is placed on an occupied square, an `Exception` is thrown.
* Otherwise the `WinCondition` enum is returned as: `WIN`, `NO_WIN` or `DRAW`.
### Undo Previous Move
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.undoPreviousMove( )
```
* This method reverses the previous move on the game board. 
### Reset Game Board
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.resetGameBoard( )
```
* This method clears the pucks from the game board.
### Reset Game Driver
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.resetGameDriver( )
```
* Clears the game board.
* Removes players from the game.
### Create New Board
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.createNewBoard(config : GameConfig)
```
* Creates new game board to the specifications of the `GameConfig` class
## Player Operations
### Editing a Player Attribute 
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.editPlayerAttribute(player : Player, attribute : String, value : Any) 
```
* `attribute` may be "playerName", "playerID", "playerAvatar", or "playerIcon"
* Edits player entry in player database. 
### Remove Player from Database
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.removePlayerFromDatabase(playerID : Int)
```
* This method removes a player from the player database by player ID.
* Player ID is unique and generated by the Player child class.
### Get Players in Database
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.getPlayersFromDatabase( ) : List<HumanPlayer?>
```
* This method returns a list of all players in the database.
* Only `HumanPlayer` implementations of `Player` are stored in the database.
### Get a Player from the Database
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.getPlayerFromDatabase(playerID : Int) : HumanPlayer?
```
* This method returns the player object from the database associated with the given `playerID`.
### Get a Player's Win Stats from the Database
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.getPlayerStatsFromDatabase(player : HumanPlayer) : Tripple<Int, Int, Int>
```
* This method returns the `losses`, `wins`, and `draws` from the database associated with the player: `player`.
### Add a Player to the Database
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.addPlayerToDatabase(player : Player? = HumanPlayer()) : Boolean
```
* Adds a player object to the database.
* If `player` isnt a `HumanPlayer`: return false,
* else if a `player` with the same `playerID` already exists, return false.
* else, return `true`
### Add a Player to the Current Game
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.addPlayerToGame(newPlayer : Player? = HumanPlayer())
```
* Adds a given player object to the `playerQueue` of the game driver.
* Players must be in the queue in order to play moves.
### Increment a Players Wins 
#### (Not implemented yet) 
```KOTLIN
GameDriver.increaseWins(playerID : Int)
