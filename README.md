## Game Setup

Player 1 will get to decide what marker the would like to be, either X or O. From there they can close to go first or second. The board size can be changed from either 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5. With Larger size boards different win conditions can be set, either 3, 4 or 5 in a row.

## Timer

Each player will have a time limit for each move. The timer for the game will start as soon as the first move is made. If the timer runs out the turn will be passed to the other player.

## Single Player Game

In this game mode you will pitted against the most advanced AI ever created..... Ok no not really it just places a marker randomly in an available spot so to give the AI a fighting chance the undo feature is unavailable for single player. Each player will have a row of X's this is the timer. If this runs out then the turn is swapped to the other play regardless if any move has been made. When the win condition is met (either 3,4 or 5 in a row) these will be highlighted and the player can use the game menu at the bottom the screen to either restart or quit.
